# TailorParticleTracking

This repository contains all the files you will need to run the particle tracking on Katana.

The `.pbs` file is the submission script and should be updated each time to reflect the run you are completing.
You can submit the job using the code: `qsub TailorArray.pbs`

The `.py` file contains the code to actually run the model. THis where you should change the number of particles seeded, the direction of run, start times etc.
